# Invoke-SharpLoader
Load encrypted and compressed C# Code from a remote Webserver straight to memory and execute it there.
Im also planing to add an option for loading local encrypted files from disk instead of a remote webserver URL.

This project was heavily inspired by Cn33liz p0wnedLoader repo here https://github.com/Cn33liz/p0wnedLoader.

By encrypting own executables with a custom password and hosting them somewhere on the internet nearly all AV-Protections and AMSI can be bypassed. :-)
